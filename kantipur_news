I have been highly devoted to my profession and have never left any room for complaints.
No testimonials provided by your paper indicate that the allegations are based on facts.
But still, you have forcefully tried to convict an innocent person who has nothing to do with that school.
Hence, the news in The Kathmandu Post clearly gives the impression that the content of the news is based on false, baseless and made up allegations.",LMV teacher responds to sexual abuse allegations by former students,https://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2019-02-12/sharma-responds.html

Having studied in the same school for a decade, let’s be honest: It’s not easy subject to talk about!
Most of us are uncomfortable about sexual abuse.
Those teachers needs to be punished for their actions, first and foremost by the school administration.

At the least, their hire should have been asked to explain the charges levelled against him publicly.
And the least the school can do is to come out with a public statement.
Going by the graphic details of his behaviour, the teacher for all purposes and intent is a pedofile—which is a serious crime in all civilised democracies.

With 13 universities currently under its purview and more provincial-level universities in the pipeline, the UGC’s scope of work is slated to increase in the coming years.
But how does the commission plan to broaden its authority?
In this conversation with The Post, Professor Dev Raj Adhikari discusses the role UGC will play in a federalised education system and how it plans to crack down on malpractices in universities.
